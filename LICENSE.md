ADDITIONAL USE GRANT
==============================================================================

This Additional Use Grant supplements the Business Source License 1.1.

Except as described under "Restricted Use", the Licensor grants you permission
to use, modify, embed, distribute, and commercially exploit this software,
subject to the conditions of the BSL 1.1.

You may use the Licensed Work for any purpose **provided it is not a
Competing Offering** as defined below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFINITION: "Competing Offering"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A “Competing Offering” means any software, product, hosted service, tool,
framework, or API that:

(a) provides AI-driven manipulation, generation, control, automation, or
    inspection of Blender scenes, objects, meshes, geometry, rendering
    operations, or Blender’s internal state; AND

(b) is marketed, positioned, or reasonably understood by users as an
    alternative, replacement, or substitute for the “blender-ai-mcp”
    system, including but not limited to: “Blender MCP Server”, “AI agent
    interface for Blender”, “AI control layer for Blender”, or similar
    terminology; AND

(c) targets the same user base, market segment, or technical purpose as the
    Licensed Work; AND

(d) is offered commercially (one-time, subscription, SaaS, bundled,
    marketplace listing, or enterprise distribution), OR is developed,
    operated, or distributed by an entity meeting the criteria in the
    Revenue Threshold section.

Any use that meets all four criteria (a)-(d) is strictly prohibited without a
separate commercial license.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERMITTED USES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following uses are explicitly permitted:

- Use in personal projects of any size  
- Internal use within an organization (any size), provided it is not a
  Competing Offering  
- Use in commercial products, tools, or pipelines that *utilize* the Licensed
  Work but do not compete with it  
- Use in games, applications, pipelines, research, academic work, and
  non-competitive AI tools  
- Creation of tutorials, courses, technical blog posts, or educational content  
- Modification, extension, and distribution of modified versions, provided the
  license remains intact  
- Consulting, implementation services, or integration work using this software  
- Forking the repository for experimentation or learning  
- Development of MCP systems for other software (e.g., Maya, Unreal, Unity)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESTRICTED USES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Without a separate commercial license from the Licensor, you MAY NOT:

- Offer any Competing Offering as defined above  
- Provide a hosted service, SaaS, cloud offering, or subscription that exposes
  or wraps the Licensed Work  
- Rebrand and commercialize the Licensed Work or substantial derivative works  
- Publish commercial plugins, bundles, or integrations whose primary purpose
  is to replicate the Licensed Work’s function as a Blender MCP server  
- Sublicense the software under permissive terms (MIT, Apache, BSD, etc.)  
- Remove or modify this license  
- Use legal or structural mechanisms to circumvent licensing restrictions  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVENUE THRESHOLD

A separate commercial license is required if the Licensed Work is used by an
entity that:

- has annual revenue exceeding USD $10 million, OR  
- employs more than 100 people, OR  
- is publicly traded, OR  
- is owned by, or acting on behalf of, a publicly traded company

  followers), OR

You may not:

- Remove or alter this license text
