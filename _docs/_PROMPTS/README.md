# Prompt Templates

Copy/paste-ready prompt templates for LLMs controlling Blender via this MCP server.

> Note: depending on your client, tool names may appear namespaced
> (e.g. `mcp__bleder-ai-mcp__inspect_scene`).
> On the `llm-guided` surface, prefer the public aliases used below:
> `check_scene`, `inspect_scene`, and `browse_workflows`.
> Legacy/internal surfaces may still expose the canonical internal names
> (`scene_context`, `scene_inspect`, `workflow_catalog`).
>
> `llm-guided` also starts from a small guided entry surface and expands with
> coarse session phases (`bootstrap` / `planning` / `build` / `inspect_validate`).
> The current guided entry surface is:
> `router_set_goal`, `router_get_status`, `browse_workflows`, `search_tools`,
> `call_tool`, `list_prompts`, and `get_prompt`.
> On production-oriented surfaces, start from `router_set_goal(...)` first and
> treat the rest of the public surface in the context of that active goal.
> Use `search_tools` / `call_tool` to discover and invoke tools on the shaped
> public surface, and use `manual_tools_no_router` when you explicitly want a
> manual non-router operating mode.
> Prefer workflow/macro tools over raw low-level atomics, and treat
> before/after capture plus deterministic verification as the normal way to
> judge whether a change is actually correct.
>
> On elicitation-capable clients, missing workflow parameters may be presented as
> structured clarification UI instead of free-form chat questions. Tool-only clients
> receive a typed `needs_input` fallback payload instead.
>
> For normal production usage, prefer workflow/macro tools over raw low-level
> atomics, and treat before/after capture plus deterministic verification as the
> standard way to judge whether a change is actually correct.

## How to use (Claude / ChatGPT)

**Recommended:** put the chosen template into your client’s **System Prompt** / **Project Instructions** / **Custom Instructions** area.
Then, in the chat, send only the actual request (what you want to model).

**If you don’t have a System Prompt field:** paste the template as the **first part** of your message, and put your request at the end under a clear marker, e.g.:

```text
<PASTE TEMPLATE HERE>

TASK:
Model a smartphone with separate parts: body, screen, camera bump, 3 lenses, power + volume buttons. Realistic size.
```

- **Demo task: generic modeling template** → [`DEMO_TASK_GENERIC_MODELING.md`](./DEMO_TASK_GENERIC_MODELING.md)

Interpretation:

- normal production LLM usage should prefer the workflow-first path
- manual/no-router mode is an explicit exception, not the default product model
